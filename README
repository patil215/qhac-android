QuickHAC for Android
====================

A port of QuickHAC to Android. 

QuickHAC simplifies grade checking for students in the Austin ISD and Round Rock ISD school districts, while adding additional tools to help students manage their grades. QuickHAC for Android is available on the [Google Play store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.patil.quickhac)

Features
--------

The app mimics the functionality of the Chrome extension. In addition to displaying class and assignment grades, it provides the following features:

-Grade change notifications

-GPA calculator

-Multiple students

Setup
-----
The project depends on the following libraries:

-[ShowcaseView Library](https://github.com/amlcurran/Showcaseview) 

-[QuickHAC Common](https://github.com/quickhac/qhac-common)

-[CardsUILib](https://github.com/nadavfima/cardsui-for-android/tree/master/CardsUILib)

When setting up the project, delete roboelectric-... jar from ShowcaseViewLibrary. For some reason the file prevents notifications from working.
